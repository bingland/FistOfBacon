            This class has helped me better understand the following three aspects of Web-Design better:
            <ul>
                <li><p>Page Structure</p></li>
                <li><p>CSS</p></li>
                <li><p>JavaScript</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <p>
            This class has been really helpful in that I feel it was a "real world" class, most classes in college just give you information,
            however this class was taught in a way that helped to give understanding of real world experience.
